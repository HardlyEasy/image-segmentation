# Purpose
Image segmentation partitions an image into multiple image regions.
Segmentation problems occur in many fields, such as medical imaging and
object identification for autonomous vehicles.

# Program Details
This program will read all images in the `input` folder and output
segmented images into the `output` folder. The segmented images will
have its different image regions colored in a random color.

Run Main.py located in `src` to start the program.
